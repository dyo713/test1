        <p>
          For our school project, we designed and implemented a comprehensive network infrastructure.
          This included setting up routers, switches, and access points to ensure seamless connectivity 
          across the school premises.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our responsibilities included network planning, configuring VLANs, establishing secure access controls,
          and implementing a robust firewall system to safeguard against potential threats.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, we conducted regular maintenance and troubleshooting to ensure the network's smooth 
          functioning, providing a reliable and efficient network environment for educational purposes.
